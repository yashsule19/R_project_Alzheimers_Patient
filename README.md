# R_project_Alzheimers_Patient
The following project is a part of coursework of the module "**Statistical Data Analysis and Visualization**" for the **M.Sc. Data Science** Course at the **Nottingham Trent University, Nottingham, England, United Kingdom**.
- **Title**: Analysing and Visualizing Alzheimer’s Patient Dataset.

## Introduction
- It is a statistical report, where I want to analyse the relationship between cognitive tasks and Alzheimer’s disease patients.

## About Dataset
- The data consists of 90 subjects, out of these 42 were male and 48 were female.
- Among 90 participants 45 participants were having Alzheimer’s disease and other 45 people were belonging to the healthy control group.
- All of them went through 100 trials of two cognitive tasks – one was related to identifying geometrical representations having different colours and another possess only grey coloured shapes.
- Out of which only the number of correct trials were reported for both the tasks and were considered for further analysis.

- The following table shows a sample of the dataset:

| Subject | ColourShapeCorrect | GreyShapeCorrect | Gender | Age | AlzheimersDisease |
| :------ | :----------------- | :--------------- | :----- | :-- | :---------------- |
| 1 | 42 | 87 | female | 58 | TRUE |
| 2 | 43 | 71 | male | 68 | FALSE |

## Tools
- **R-Studio** :
    - To carry out various statistical tests such as hypothesis testing, normality testing, correlation analysis by using inbuilt R - functions.
    - To generate graphs for visualizations such boxplots, QQ plots, histograms. 
- **Word** : To document each outcome from the dataset after performing various statistial testing techniques.

## Conclusion
- Alzheimer’s disease patients performed badly at the cognitive engagements and no matter what type of sex it is as the age increases the ability to recognize colour shapes and grey shapes decreases.
